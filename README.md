## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I built this app to learn more about REST APIs and MVVM design patterns. I used REST APIs to get the data from the internet and implement it in my app. The biggest problem was connecting ViewModels with ViewControllers but with help from apple documentation and some useful articles online, I managed to bind them and share data between them. Also, I learned how to navigate through controllers using segues.
